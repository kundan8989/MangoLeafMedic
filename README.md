# MangoLeafMedic

MangoLeafMedic is an AI-powered tool designed to assist in diagnosing diseases in mango leaves and recommending appropriate treatments. This project leverages machine learning for disease prediction and utilizes GPT-based models to suggest medicines tailored to the diagnosed condition. The aim is to provide farmers and agricultural enthusiasts with an efficient and accurate solution to manage mango tree health.

Features

-Disease Detection: Predicts the type of disease affecting the mango leaf using advanced machine learning algorithms.

-Medicine Recommendation: Suggests effective treatments for the diagnosed disease using GPT-based natural language processing.

-User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for uploading leaf images and receiving instant results.

{{**How It Works**}}

Image Upload: The user uploads an image of the mango leaf.

Disease Prediction: The system analyzes the image and identifies the disease affecting the leaf.

Treatment Suggestion: Based on the disease, the GPT model recommends suitable medicines or treatments.
